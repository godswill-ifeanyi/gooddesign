# Personal Website

This is my personal website developed with plain JavaScript, it basically describe who I am and what I do. 
With a section for the previous projects I have worked on and also the current projects am working on.
To me, it's not just about building apps, learning to program, gave me problem solving skills and a way to communicate with others on a technical level.
